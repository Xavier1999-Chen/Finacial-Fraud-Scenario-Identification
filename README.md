COMP7410 MIni Case Study

a list of Fraud Scheme in ENRON case.

1. Mark-to-market accounting fraud: Enron used aggressive accounting techniques to inflate the value of its assets and hide its debts. They would record anticipated future profits from long-term contracts immediately, rather than over the life of the contract.

2. Off-balance sheet entities: Enron created numerous special purpose entities (SPEs) to move debt and assets off the balance sheet. These entities were used to hide losses and inflate profits, allowing Enron to deceive investors about its true financial health.

3. Round-trip trading: Enron engaged in round-trip trading, where it would buy and sell energy commodities to itself or a third party with no change in ownership or delivery. This created the illusion of increased trading volumes and revenue, boosting Enron's stock price.

4. Phantom electricity trading: Enron reported profits from fictional electricity trades that never actually occurred. They would create false trading records to make it seem like transactions had taken place, leading investors to believe the company was more profitable than it actually was.

5. Manipulation of reserves: Enron manipulated its reserves, particularly in the energy trading division, to create artificial shortages and drive up prices. This allowed Enron to profit from the price fluctuations and take advantage of market volatility.

6. Insider trading: Several Enron executives, including CEO Jeffrey Skilling and CFO Andrew Fastow, engaged in illegal insider trading. They sold their Enron shares based on non-public information about the company's financial problems, avoiding significant losses.

7. Shredding of documents: Enron employees were instructed to destroy documents and evidence related to the company's fraudulent activities. This was an attempt to obstruct investigations and hide the extent of Enron's wrongdoing.

8. False financial statements: Enron falsified its financial statements by misrepresenting its revenues, expenses, and liabilities. The company inflated its profits and concealed its debts, giving investors a false picture of its financial health.

9. Conflict of interest: Enron executives, such as Andrew Fastow, created personal partnerships and entities that were involved in transactions with Enron. These conflicts of interest allowed them to enrich themselves at the expense of the company.

10. Lack of corporate governance: Enron's board of directors failed to exercise proper oversight and due diligence. They approved the company's fraudulent accounting practices and were complicit in the fraudulent activities, contributing to the collapse of the company.

the detail of the "Insider trading" one.

Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of securities, such as stocks or options, based on non-public information about a company. In the Enron case, several executives engaged in illegal insider trading, including CEO Jeffrey Skilling and CFO Andrew Fastow. Here are some details about the insider trading scheme in the Enron case:

1. Timing of stock sales: Skilling and Fastow sold significant amounts of Enron stock prior to the public disclosure of the company's financial problems. For example, Skilling sold over $60 million worth of Enron shares in the months leading up to the company's bankruptcy filing.

2. Knowledge of financial problems: Skilling and Fastow had access to non-public information about Enron's deteriorating financial condition. They were aware of the company's mounting debts, failing ventures, and fraudulent accounting practices. This information would have significantly impacted Enron's stock price had it been made public.

3. Use of special purpose entities (SPEs): Fastow, as the CFO, created and managed several off-balance sheet entities known as Special Purpose Entities. These entities were used to hide Enron's debts and inflate profits. Fastow used his insider knowledge to structure deals that benefited himself and his partners at the expense of Enron shareholders.

4. Personal enrichment: Skilling and Fastow used their insider knowledge to sell Enron stock at inflated prices, avoiding significant losses when the stock price eventually collapsed. They profited personally while ordinary shareholders suffered substantial financial losses.

5. Non-public information on company performance: Skilling and Fastow were aware of Enron's true financial performance, which was far worse than what was being disclosed to the public. They took advantage of this information by selling their shares at high prices, deceiving other investors who were unaware of the company's actual financial situation.

6. Violation of securities laws: Insider trading is illegal under securities laws as it undermines the fairness and integrity of the financial markets. Skilling and Fastow violated these laws by trading Enron stock based on non-public information, gaining an unfair advantage over other investors.

7. Legal consequences: Both Skilling and Fastow were eventually charged and convicted for their involvement in the Enron scandal. Skilling was convicted of multiple counts of securities fraud, insider trading, and conspiracy, while Fastow pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. They both received significant prison sentences and financial penalties for their actions.

The insider trading scheme in the Enron case was a key component of the larger fraud scheme that ultimately led to the downfall of the company. It highlights the unethical behavior and exploitation of inside information by top executives for personal gain, at the expense of shareholders and investors.
